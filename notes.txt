----------------------------------------
Version and outside source comparison

# Average proportional difference of non-zero intensity: ~25% higher in version 1 than version 2, 
# probably moslty due to our incorrect interpretation of area denominators in Kurucz's information.

# Outside source data looks similar both for the Sun and for Vega, the differences are probably due to the
# imprecise knowledge of Vega's rotational velocity and luminosity 
-------------------------
Mention the possibility of using the python Decimal module / mpmath in Newton's method
Mention structured arrays as a possible way to store limb darkening data
