# Planetary transit: 200 dpi, linewidth = 1
# vega at i = pi/3, b = 0, alpha = pi/3
7, 19, 100 points produce lines that are not distinguishable from each other
1 point is visibly distinguishable from these near the edges of the star

# Runtimes:

# Memory usage.

calc_limbdark -> 50 Mb file.
calc_star -> 14 Mb file.


# Convergence analysis. 

An etalon spectrum is produced with 40K z values.


# Version and outside source comparison

Average proportional difference of non-zero intensity: ~25% higher in version 1 than version 2, probably moslty due to our incorrect interpretation of area denominators in Kurucz's information.

Outside source data looks similar both for the Sun and for Vega, the differences are probably due to the imprecise knowledge of Vega's rotational velocity and luminosity 

Distance to Vega from Hipparcos 2007: 2.3694 Ã— 10^19 cm

## Commands useful for working with Kurucz's files

# converting from CR (old Apple style) to LF (unix style) newlines
tr '\r' '\n' < im01k2.pck > im01k2.unix
# finding the intensities at some temperature, gravity and wavelength = 401
grep -A 385 'TEFF\s*5750.\s*GRAVITY\s*2.0' im01k2.unix
# pre-pend pound signs to lines without intensity numbers in a .pck file from Castelli and Kurucz
sed '/TEFF/{s/^/#/;n;s/^/#/;n;s/^/#/;}' im05k2.pck > im05k2.pck


# Useful git commands

git checkout -b feature/faster_interpolation  # create a branch and switch to it
# update the remote reference, add an upstream reference to the new branch
git push --set-upstream origin feature/faster_interpolation 
git checkout master # switch back to master branch
git merge feature/faster_interpolation # merge the history of the feature branch onto master
git push # push the merge
git branch # look at branches  
git branch -d feature/faster_interpolation # delete a branch
# tell the remote server to stop tracking the branch
git push --delete origin feature/faster_interpolation 
# in the parent directory (not in paint_atmospheres)
git clone https://github.com/mlipatov/paint_atmospheres # clone the project on a local computer
git pull # pull the remote repository's latest updates 
git checkout higher_order_integration # switch to another branch in the newly cloned project


## Useful python command line commands

# look at function definitions in python
import sys, inspect
sys.stdout.write(inspect.getsource(surf.R))
