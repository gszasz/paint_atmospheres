Name: PARS (Paint the Atmospheres of Rotating Stars).

Authors: 
	Timothy D. Brandt
	Mikhail Lipatov

Model: 
	Roche model of mass distribution, 
	solid body rotation,
	energy flux collinear with effective gravity.

Features:
	A closed-form expression for the azimuthal integral,
	a high-order approximation of the longitudinal integral,
	a precise calculation of surface effective temperature.

Installation (Unix):
	git clone https://github.com/mlipatov/paint_atmospheres
	cd paint_atmospheres
	pip install .
	# put a .pck file in ./data

Executables:
	calc_limbdark computes fits of intensity w.r.t surface inclination
	calc_star performs inclination-independent computations
	calc_spectra computes spectra for multiple inclinations
	plot_spectra plots spectra 
	plot_Imu plots a fit of intensity versus surface inclination
	convert_spectrum converts a spectrum between units
	<command> -h provides usage instructions
