# Convergence analysis

An etalon spectrum is produced with 20K z values. 
Using the quadratic approximation with 200 z values.
Vega with i = pi/4 and lambda = 999 nm yields below 10^-5 error.
Vega with i = pi/2 and lambda = 501 nm yields below 10^-3 error.
Fast sun (Req = 1, omega = 0.99) with i = pi/4 and lambda = 701 nm yields below 10^-6 error.

# Version comparison

Average proportional difference of non-zero intensity: ~25% higher in version 1 than version 2, probably moslty due to our incorrect interpretation of area denominators in Kurucz's information.
